I believe my extensive experience teaching coding to hundreds of students from diverse backgrounds has equipped me with exceptional communication skills and the ability to build strong rapport. Those who know me would describe me as someone who consistently goes above and beyond, always willing to lend a helping hand. My guiding principle is to pay forward the opportunities that were extended to me, by opening doors for others and expanding access for the benefit of the wider community. You will find me to be exceptional in handling customer queries, driven by a genuine eagerness to "get things done" through thorough research and attention to detail. Having previously worked at a startup, I understand the importance of a passionate, proactive mindset - treating the business as if it were my own and being willing to go the extra mile when needed.
